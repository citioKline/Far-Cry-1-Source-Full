# Thinking Recursively With Java: A Book Review
 
Thinking Recursively With Java is a book by Eric Roberts, a professor of computer science at Stanford University. The book, published in 2006, is a 20th anniversary edition of his original book Thinking Recursively, which was published in 1986. The book aims to teach the concept of recursion, which is a fundamental technique in computer science that involves solving problems by breaking them down into smaller and simpler subproblems.

The book covers various topics related to recursion, such as mathematical preliminaries, recursive functions, the procedural approach, the tower of Hanoi, permutations, sorting, recursive backtracking, graphical applications, recursive data, and implementation of recursion. The book uses Java as the programming language to illustrate the examples and exercises. The book also provides access to the ACM Java Libraries, which are a collection of classes and interfaces that support graphical user interface programming and abstract data types.
 
The book is intended for undergraduate students who have some experience with programming in Java. The book assumes that the reader is familiar with basic concepts such as variables, expressions, statements, loops, arrays, and objects. The book does not require any prior knowledge of recursion or advanced mathematics. The book is designed to be used as a supplementary text for courses on data structures, algorithms, or discrete mathematics.
 
The book is well-written and engaging, with clear explanations and examples. The book also includes many exercises and projects that challenge the reader to apply the concepts learned. The book is suitable for anyone who wants to learn more about recursion and its applications in computer science.

The book has received positive reviews from readers and critics alike. On Goodreads, the book has an average rating of 4.27 out of 5 stars, based on 15 ratings and 1 review . On Amazon, the book has an average rating of 4 out of 5 stars, based on 16 ratings and 9 reviews . Some of the praises for the book include:
 
- "Superb. I don't program in Java, mainly c++. If you program in any c-style language you will find this book insightful in Thinking about recursion. The examples are great and the book is written in a very nice style." - JacobeanEra
- "Thinking Recursively In Java. The author treats the very important subject of recursion from the ground up with the necessary fundamentals. The examples are significant and introduce the reader to the use of data structures and algorithms." - Gary
- "This is a great book for learning recursion. It explains the concept very clearly and gives many examples and exercises. The Java code is easy to follow and well-commented. The book also covers some advanced topics such as recursive backtracking and graphical applications." - Anonymous

However, some readers also pointed out some drawbacks of the book, such as:

- "No solutions to exercises. People pay for the books so they can learn, there is no point in having exercises with no solution. This is simply unfair and robs people from both learning opportunity and their money." - PumpkinPieLatte
- "The book is too short and does not cover enough topics. It would be better if it had more chapters on topics such as recursion trees, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, memoization, etc." - Anonymous
- "The book is outdated and does not reflect the current state of Java programming. It uses an old version of Java and does not cover features such as generics, lambda expressions, streams, etc." - Anonymous

Overall, Thinking Recursively With Java is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn or improve their skills in recursion and its applications in computer science. The book is well-written, engaging, and informative, with clear explanations and examples. The book also provides access to useful resources such as the ACM Java Libraries and the author's website. However, the book also has some limitations, such as lack of solutions to exercises, insufficient coverage of topics, and outdated code. Therefore, readers may want to supplement their learning with other sources or newer editions of the book.
